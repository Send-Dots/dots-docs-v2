![Dots Flows](../images/flows.png)

Onboard your users, let them manage their payout accounts and preferences, and then pay them out when needed.

## Flow Steps

### Authentication and Onboarding

The `authentication` and `onboarding` step are automatically added to the start of your flow when a `user_id` is not provided in the API call. When this step is complete, a `user_id` is added to the `flow` object.

### Compliance

Adding the `compliance` step to your flow will force the collection of a user's SSN, date of birth, and address if based in the US. Otherwise, the `compliance` step will be added automatically based on local tax laws.

### ID Verification

Adding the `id-verification` step to your flow will force the collection and verification of user's government-issued ID and matching of their facial scan to that ID.

### Payment Method Management

The `manage-payments` lets a user connect their US bank account for payments to your app.

### Payout Method Management

The `manage-payouts` lets a user connect their desired payout methods to Dots and choose a default method.

### Payout

The `payout` step lets the user withdraw their funds to their preferred payout method.

### Redirect

The `redirect` step lets you redirect the user to a URL of your choice. The `redirect` step looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "redirect",
  "redirect_url": "https://example.com"
}
```

## Example Flow

This example flow onboards a user, collects compliance information, and then lets them manage their payment methods.

```bash
> curl https://pls.senddotssandbox.com/v2/flow/create \
-X POST \
-u "CLIENT_ID:API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
      "steps": ["compliance", "manage-payouts"],
    }'

> response = {
    "id": "5f0f8f8f-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8f8f8f8f8",
    "created": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z",
    "updated": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z",
    "user_id": null,
    "steps": ["compliance", "manage-payouts"],
    "completed_steps": [],
    "payout_link_id": null,
    "link": "https://my.senddotssandbox.com/flow/5f0f8f8f-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8f8f8f8f8",
}

```

A webhook is sent to your app on completion of every step of the flow.
