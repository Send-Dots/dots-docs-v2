Onboard your users, let them manage their payout accounts and preferences, and then pay them out when needed.

## Flow Steps

### Authentication and Onboarding

The `authentication` and `onboarding` step are automatically added to the start of your flow when a `user_id` is not provided in the API call. When this step is complete, a `user_id` is added to the `flow` object.

### Compliance

Adding the `compliance` step to your flow will force the collection of a user's SSN, date of birth, and address if based in the US. Otherwise, the `compliance` step will be added automatically based on local tax laws.

**In sandbox**: The compliance step will always be shown even if tax information has already been collected for the user. This allows testing the form without creating a new user.

### ID Verification

Adding the `id-verification` step to your flow will force the collection and verification of user's government-issued ID and matching of their facial scan to that ID.

### Background Check

Adding the `background-check` step to your flow will run a background check on U.S.-based users over 18, including criminal history and sex offender registry. The status is available via `background_check.status` with values: `not_started`, `started`, `pending`, `consider`, `pass`, `failed`, `canceled`, or `expired`. If the check fails, `user.has_criminal_activity` will be `true` and an email notification is sent to the app.

<Note>
For legacy background checks conducted before January 1, 2026, criminal and sex offender checks were separate steps. The `sex_offender_check_status` field may contain data for these older checks. For checks conducted after this date, the single `status` field reflects the combined result.
</Note>

### Payment Method Management

The `manage-payments` lets a user connect their US bank account for payments to your app.

### Payout Method Management

The `manage-payouts` lets a user connect their desired payout methods to Dots and choose a default method. You can optionally hide the continue button on the flow UI so the user stays on this step, useful for embedded iframe application:

```json
{
  "name": "manage-payouts",
  "hide_continue_button": true
}
```

### Payout

The `payout` step lets the user withdraw their funds to their preferred payout method.

### Redirect

The `redirect` step lets you redirect the user to a URL of your choice. The `redirect` step looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "redirect",
  "redirect_url": "https://example.com"
}
```

## Example Flow

This example flow onboards a user, collects compliance information, and then lets them manage their payment methods.

```bash
> curl https://pls.senddotssandbox.com/v2/flow/create \
-X POST \
-u "CLIENT_ID:API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
      "steps": ["compliance", "manage-payouts"],
    }'

> response = {
    "id": "5f0f8f8f-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8f8f8f8f8",
    "created": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z",
    "updated": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z",
    "user_id": null,
    "steps": ["compliance", "manage-payouts"],
    "completed_steps": [],
    "payout_link_id": null,
    "link": "https://my.senddotssandbox.com/flow/5f0f8f8f-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8-f8f8f8f8f8f8",
}

```

A webhook is sent to your app on completion of every step of the flow.
