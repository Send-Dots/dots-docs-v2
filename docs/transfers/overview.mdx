---

A transfer is a collection of transactions on the Dots platform representing a movement of funds. There are three types of transfers: balance, payout and refill. A balance transfer is a transfer of funds between an app's wallet and a user's wallet. A payout transfer is a transfer of funds from a user's account to their external account. A refill transfer is a transfer of funds from a bank account to a user's wallet.

A transfer can only be created between a user's wallet and your app's wallet in both directions. User to User transfers aren't directly allowed. To create a payout, you must call the `/payouts` endpoint.
