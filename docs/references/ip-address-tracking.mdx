title: "IP Address Tracking"
---

To improve fraud protection and security, you can now optionally pass in the end user's IP Address to Dots by adding in the Dots-User-IP header to all user related requests like `create-user` and `create-transfer`.
Dots will log all IP addresses related to a user and flag the user based on fraudulent behavior.


## How to Use IP Address Tracking

You can include the `Dots-User-IP` header in your API request. The following example demonstrates a request to create a user where the end user's IP Address is specified.

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dots.dev/api/v2/users \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Dots-User-IP: 192.0.2.0' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "first_name": "Bob",
  "last_name": "Loblaw",
  "email": "bob@bobloblaw.com",
  "country_code": "1",
  "phone_number": "4154332334",
  "metadata": {
    "internal_id": "user_121344"
  }
}'
```
