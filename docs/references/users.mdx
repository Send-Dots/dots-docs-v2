A `user` is a representation of a person or entity in the Dots system. A `user` can be created by a platform or by the `user` themselves but can be connected to any platform.

The platform can add additional data to a `user` such as an SSN and address for tax purposes and add bank accounts and other payment methods.

## Creating a user

Creating users happens through the [/v2/users](/api-reference/v2/users/create-user) endpoint. Once hit, a dots user will be created if one does not exist based on phone number. This user must then be verified through a one-time code sent over text-message. This code can be requested through the [/v2/users/\{user_id\}/send-verification-token](/api-reference/v2/users/send-verification-token) endpoint and then verified through the [/v2/users/\{user_id\}/verify](/api-reference/v2/users/verify-user) endpoint.

## TIN submission and verification

A user's Tax Identification Number (TIN) is either their United States
Social Security Number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN), or
their Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN). A user's TIN may be
submitted through a [payout link](/guides/payout-links), a
[compliance flow](/guides/flow-payouts), or through
[POST /users/:id/compliance](/apireference/users/submit-compliance-information)
API endpoint.

Once submitted, a user's TIN will automatically be verified. This
usually takes a few seconds, or rarely up to a day. You can check the
status of the TIN verification in the `compliance.w9.tax_id_verification`
field returned the [GET /user/:id](apireference/users/retrieve-a-user) endpoint.
The possible statuses are:
- `unsubmitted`: The user's TIN has not been submitted yet.
- `pending`: The user's TIN is pending verification.
- `matched`: The user's TIN was successfully verified and matched their name.
- `mismatched`: The user's TIN did not match their name.

A mismatched TIN may be corrected by resubmitting the correct TIN.
