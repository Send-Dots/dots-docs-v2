Title: Webhooks
---

## Introduction

Webhooks are how services notify each other of events, so in Dots they let you receive real-time notifications for things like Payout Links, Flows, and Transfers. At their core they are just a POST request to a pre-determined endpoint that you can configure from the dashboard UI. You normally use one endpoint per service, and that endpoint listens to all event types. For example, if you receive webhooks from Acme Inc., you can structure your URL like `https://www.example.com/acme/webhooks/`.

The way to indicate that a webhook has been processed is by returning a 2xx (status code 200-299) response to the webhook message within a reasonable time-frame (15s). It's also important to disable CSRF protection for this endpoint if the framework you use enables it by default.

Another important aspect of handling webhooks is to verify the signature and timestamp when processing them. You can learn more about it in the signature verification section.

## Configuring Webhooks

Dots uses [Svix](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/introduction/) to deliver webhooks. To access the Svix dashboard, follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Dots dashboard](https://dashboard.dots.dev/).
2. From the sidebar, choose the desired App from your list or head to the Organization settings to configure organization level webhooks.
3. Navigate to the **API Management** tab for the link to the Svix dashboard.

Once in the Svix dashboard do the following:
1. Click on **+ Add Endpoint** to add a new webhook.
2. Provide a URL or use an endpoint generated by Svix. Optionally, add a description to define the purpose of the webhook.
3. Select the event types to which the endpoint should be subscribed. If no event is selected, the webhook will register for all events.
4. Optionally, enable a rate limit for the endpoint.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Note the webhook signing secret.

A new endpoint will be created to group all information from the notification received.

## Available events

When creating an endpoint on Svix, you can subscribe to a wide list of events to receive notifications. The following accordions list the available events and present webhook notifications examples:
