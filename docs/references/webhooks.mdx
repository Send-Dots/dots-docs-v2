Dots provides webhook events to track Payout Links, Flows, and Transfers. Webhook endpoints can be configred through Svix in the Api Managment tab.

## Payout Link Events

### `payout_link.updated`

This webhook event is fired when there is a change to the Payout Link's status with the following body:

```json
{
  "event": "payout_link.updated",
  "payout_link_id": "618a48cb-9ffb-4916-8b63-896a92d59443"
}
```

## Flow Events

This webhook event is fired when a user completes Flow steps. A Payout Link is a kind of Flow so it will also trigger this event.
