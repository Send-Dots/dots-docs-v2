An `app` is a logically seperated instance of the Dots platform. Each app has its own set of users, payouts, and payout methods. Apps are useful for multi-tenancy applications where you want to logically seperate funds and users on your platform. For example if you platform has customers that each have a different balance, bank account, and users, you can create an `app` for each customer.
