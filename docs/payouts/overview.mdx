title: "Payouts Overview"
---

A `payout` is a type of transfer of funds from a `user`'s Dots wallet to an external account (such as a bank account). A payout can be initiated by a `user` through Flows, Payout Links or through API calls.

## Flow Payouts

Read more about creating a payout through a Flow [here](/flows/overview).

## Payout Links

Payouts links can be created through the [`/v2/payouts/send-payout`]() endpoint or if more customization is needed, the [`/v2/payout-links`]() endpoint.

The `send-payout` endpoint is a convenience endpoint that sends a Payout Link to new users and delivers the payout to the user's default method if they already exist.

## White-labeled Payouts

For a more white-labeled experience, you can first add a payout method to a user using the [`/v2/users/{user_id}/payout-methods`](https://dots.mintlify.com/users/add_payout_methods) endpoint and then calling the [`/v2/payouts`]() endpoint.
