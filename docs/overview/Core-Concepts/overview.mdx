  <Card title="Users"  icon="user">
   Represent individuals or businesses registered on Dots.

  <Card title="Applications" icon="browser">
  The primary way to interact with Dots. 
Each application has a unique API key and secret for authentication. 
You can create multiple applications, each managing its users. 
Applications let you configure webhook endpoints and track transaction history.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfers" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Represent money movement on the Dots platform. 
A transfer can consist of multiple transactions, like moving funds from your app's wallet to a user's wallet or covering payout and payment fees. 
Transfers handle internal (wallet-to-wallet) and external movements (payouts and payments). 
Each transfer has a lifecycle that can be tracked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transactions" icon="wallet">
   Individual entries on the Dots ledger represent money movement between wallets. 
   Transactions cannot be created directly; they're generated as part of a transfer.
  </Card>
   <Card title="Payout Links" icon="link">
  A simplified way to send money without user creation or transfers. 
You provide basic information (phone number or email), and Dots handles the onboarding complexities. 
Once claimed, the payout link becomes associated with a user, allowing future payouts.
  </Card>
   <Card title="Flows" icon="arrow-progress">
  User interface components provided by Dots. 
Each flow guides users through the onboarding process with a series of steps. 
You can customize flows to match your brand and embed them directly in your application. 
Flows can be created in either pre-authenticated (automatically logged-in user) or unauthenticated (user login or account creation required) states.
