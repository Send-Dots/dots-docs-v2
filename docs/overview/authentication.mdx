Requests are authorized with a Basic token which requires a `client_id` and an `api_key`.

The Basic token is the URL-safe Base64 encoding of a string which contains your `client_id` followed by a `:` for client side requests and your `client_id` and your `api_key` separated by a colon for server side requests.

Header format:

```javascript
Authorization: Basic {token}
```

### Client Side Requests

Token format:

```javascript
BASE64_ENCODE({client_id}):
```

Example:

```javascript
ABC123 -> QUJDMTIzOg==
```

### Server Side Requests

Token format:

```javascript
BASE64_ENCODE({client_id}:{api_key})
```

Example:

```javascript
ABC123:DEF456 -> QUJDMTIzOkRFRjQ1Ng==
```
