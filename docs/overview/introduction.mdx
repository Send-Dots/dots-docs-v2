Our API aims to make moving money between businesses and people easy and modular. Whether you want to enable payouts to users via ACH or Venmo, build an embeddable wallet system into your application, or even just file 1099 forms, we've built an API to take all of the hassle away.

In this documentation, you'll find everything you need to get started with Dots.
