title: "Working with Unverified Users"
---

You may want to create transactions with users before you verify their accounts. To do this, you can use the following endpoints with a `verification_id` instead of a `user_id`.

## Get the User by a Verification ID

You can get information about a user by providing their verification ID.

### Method

#### 1. Call the [get_by_verification_id](/api-reference/users/retrieve-limited-info) endpoint

```bash cURL
curl https://api.senddotssandbox.com/v2/users/get_by_verification_id/{verification_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <TOKEN>"

response = {
  "success": true,
  "connected": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "5d8f8f8f-8f8f-8f8f-8f8f-8f8f8f8f8f8f", // note the ID will be null if the user is not verified
    "first_name": "Bob",
    "last_name": "John",
    "username": "bob_john",
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "wallet": {
      "amount": 0,
      "withdrawable_amount": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Send Funds to an Unverified User

Funds can be sent to an unverified user. To retrieve funds from an unverified user, you will need to first verify them.

### Method

#### 1. Call the [create_unverified](/api-reference/transactions/create-transaction) endpoint

```bash cURL
curl https://api.senddotssandbox.com/v2/transactions/create_unverified \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "verification_id": "5bcbf7ac-c998-46ce-aa6e-a0c1a3f1f5bd",
        "amount": 1150,
        "receipt": {
          "items": [
          {
            "name": "Toy",
            "unit_amount": 1110,
            "quantity": 1,
            "description": "A tpy"
          }
          ],
          "breakdown": {
            "items_total": 1110
            "tax": 10,
            "shipping": 30
          }
        },
        "notes": {},
        "idempotency_key": "0cd90e5a-2c03-4ab6-81a8-d48818026e58"
      }'

response = {
  "success": true,
  "message": "string",
  "transaction": {
    "id": 234253546,
    "date": "string",
    "source_username": "Dots App",
    "destination_username": "bob_john",
    "amount": 1150,
    "type": "wallet",
    "completed": true,
    "notes": {},
    "receipt": {
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Toy",
          "unit_amount": 1110,
          "quantity": 1,
          "description": "A tpy"
        }
      ],
      "breakdown": {
        "items_total": 1110,
        "tax": 10,
        "shipping": 30
      }
    },
    "credit_transaction_id": "string"
  }
}

```

## Payout to an Unverified User

To payout to an unverified user, you can generate a payout link for them. They will first be verified and then can widthdraw funds.

### Method

#### 1. Call the [/users/wallet/payout](/api-reference/users/generate-link-refill) endpoint

```bash cURL
curl https://pls.senddotssandbox.com/v2/users/wallet/payout \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "verification_id": "8732b0e5-8d47-4be7-839f-5cdecbe2df99"
      }'

response = {
    "success": true,
    "link": "https://senddotssandbox.com/payout/Bug3toxuH6QCv9au820z5iZPfmQvZohAvMaNrpIASGXzk9asgkldjla"
  }
```
