Payout Links is the most straightforward solution offered by Dots, allowing you to send money without the need to create a user or transfer manually. 

You can send a payout link automatically through email or SMS or share the link manually. New payees will be guided through a quick onboarding process and given tons of convenient payment options to receive their payout.

## Requirements

Before creating your first Payout Link, you must have:

- A Dots account.
- Created an App using the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.dots.dev/) or the Dots API.

If you haven't completed one of these steps, access the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started) before continuing.

## 1. Creating a Payout Link

You can create a Payout Link using the Dashboard or the API. Below you will find the steps to create a Payout Link using each of these options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Access and log in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.dots.dev/).
    2. Select the desired App from the sidebar selector. 
    3. Access the **Send Payout** tab and select **Payout Links**.
    4. Provide the payout information. The only information required at this step is the **Amount** and the delivery method, which can be:
        - **Link**: Use this option to share the link manually.
        - **SMS**: If you choose this option, you must provide the payees' phone numbers. The link will be automatically shared.
        - **Email**: If you choose this option, you must provide the payees' email. The link will be automatically shared.
    5. Click **Submit**. 

    If you choose Link, the Payout Link will appear below the Submit button. If you choose SMS or Email, the link will be automatically shared.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    To create the Payout Link using the API, you will need to use the **App API Key** and **Client ID**. You can find this information by accessing the Dashboard, selecting the desired App, and then selecting **API Management** on the sidebar. 
    
    With your credentials, you can create the Payout Link using the [Create a Payout Link](/api-reference/payout-links/create-a-payout-link) endpoint. The only required parameter is the `amount` value. However, you have several other options available, which are described in the following table:

## 2. Using the Payout Link

When the payee receives and uses the Payout Link, they'll be redirected to the Dots portal. The payees will be guided through a quick onboarding process. The payee will complete the following steps:

1. Enter a phone number.
2. Verify the phone number.
3. Submit the IRS Form W-8BEN. 
4. Select the payment method.
5. Provide the payment method information.

Payees can retrieve their funds using several payout rails, such as local bank transfers, wire transfers, and PayPal. Access the [Supported Countries](/references/supported-countries) page to see what payment options are available in your country.

The following video presents an example of when the payee doesn't need to submit the IRS Form W-8BEN and selects the Amazon Gift card as the payment method.
