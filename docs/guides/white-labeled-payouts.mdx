title: 'White-Labeled Payouts'
---

All Dots solutions are available through its API. If you're a business with a developer team who want full control over the payout process and prefer to use your UI, the white-label approach based on the Dots API is the best option. This page presents a guide with all the steps to create payouts using the Dots API.

## Requirements

Before creating a payout using Dots API, you must have:

- A Dots account.
- Created an App.

If you still need to complete one of these steps, access the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started) before continuing.

## 1. Capture User Information and Create a User

The first step to create a payout is to create a user in Dots. To create a user, you must first capture user information through your system. This will include details such as first name, last name, email, country code, and phone number.

After capturing the user information, you can create a user in Dots using the [Create a User](/api-reference/users/create-a-user) endpoint. Following, you will find the list of required parameters:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `country_code`
- `phone_number`

You can add additional information when creating the user or use metadata to provide complementary information that may be useful for your system, such as an internal `id`. For additional information, see the [Metadata](/references/metadata) documentation page. In addition, you can later update the user account using the [Update a User](/api-reference/users/update-a-user) endpoint.

The following code block presents request and response examples of creating a user.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://pls.senddotssandbox.com/api/v2/users \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic cGtfZGV2X3lpYXF0aXkwOGdIb3gzR3pvUEo2RlFsaURkSDRnOnNrX2Rldl9nUDBHQjZCd1FmZmt3S2FEVkh0UmdTd0NPT2RNVA==' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "first_name": "Bob",
  "last_name": "Loblaw",
  "email": "bob@bobloblaw.com",
  "country_code": "1",
  "phone_number": "4154332334",
  "metadata": {
    "internal_id": "user_121344"
  }
}'
```

```json Response
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "first_name": "Bob",
  "id": "fc54b468-bbb2-403f-be36-5627a8e3c7a4",
  "last_name": "Loblaw",
  "metadata": {
    "internal_id": "user_121344"
  },
  "phone_number": {
    "country_code": "55",
    "phone_number": "49933801774"
  },
  "status": "unverified",
  "verified": false
}
```
</CodeGroup>

You will receive the user `id` in the response upon successful creation.

## 2. Submit Compliance Information 

Depending on the user's location, you may need to capture and submit their compliance information:

- For users based in the United States, you must provide the W-9 equivalent form.
- For foreign payees, you must provide the W8-BEN form.

To submit the compliance information to Dots, use the [Submit Compliance Information](/api-reference/users/submit-compliance-information) endpoint. You must inform the `user_id`, which is the same `id` received in step 1.

## 3. Verify the User

Next, you need to verify the user. First, send a verification code to the user's phone using the [Send a Verification Token](/api-reference/users/send-a-verification-token) endpoint. The user will receive a verification code in the registered phone number used to create their account in step 1. The [Send a Verification Token](/api-reference/users/send-a-verification-token) endpoint will return a 202 HTTP response for successful requests. 

After sending the verification code, you have to provide a UI for the user to enter the verification code they receive. Capture the code and use the code shared by the user to verify their account using the [Verify a User](/api-reference/users/verify-a-user) endpoint. Successful requests will return a 200 HTTP response.

## 4. Transfer Funds to User Account

Now that the user has a verified account, you can transfer funds to their account using the [Create a Transfer](/api-reference/users/verify-a-user) endpoint.   You must provide at least the following information:

- `amount` in cents, using a negative value to transfer funds to the user.
- `user_id`

The following code block presents request and response examples of transferring funds to a user's account.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dots.dev/api/v2/transfers \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic cGtfZGV2X3lpYXF0aXkwOGdIb3gzR3pvUEo2RlFsaURkSDRnOnNrX2Rldl9nUDBHQjZCd1FmZmt3S2FEVkh0UmdTd0NPT2RNVA==' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "amount": -1000,
  "user_id": "fc54b468-bbb2-403f-be36-5627a8e3c7a4"
}'
```
```json Response
{
  "amount": "-1000",
  "created": "2024-07-12T11:07:42.842008",
  "external_data": {},
  "id": "c9ce3235-2a9d-474d-a6ac-0ebd95d66aa0",
  "metadata": null,
  "status": "completed",
  "status_history": [
    {
      "status": "completed",
      "timestamp": "Fri, 12 Jul 2024 11:07:42 GMT"
    }
  ],
  "transactions": [
    {
      "amount": "1000.0000000000",
      "created": "2024-07-12T11:07:42.828513",
      "destination_name": "enamored-education",
      "id": 767408,
      "metadata": null,
      "source_name": "TestWriteChoiceApp",
      "type": "balance"
    }
  ],
  "type": "balance",
  "user_id": "f33919ae-6793-41bd-b512-1ad3c19f4ecb"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Once completed, the funds will be available in the user’s account.

## 5. Add a Payout Method

To enable users to withdraw their transferred funds, follow these steps:


1. Present the available payout methods so users can choose their preferred one. All available payout methods by country are available on the [Supported Countries](/references/supported-countries) page. Present these options to the user and capture their selection.
2. Capture the payout method information based on the user's selection and gather all necessary information for the chosen payout method.
3. Register the payout method using the [Add a Payout Method](/api-reference/users/add-a-payout-method) endpoint to add it to the user’s account. Provide the `user_id` and the required payout method information, which varies depending on the selected method.

## 6. Create a Payout

As the final step, with the payout method added, you can now create the payout to enable the user to withdraw their funds. Use the [Create a Payout](/api-reference/users/verify-a-user) endpoint, providing the `user_id`, the `amount` using the same as the one used in the transfer in step 4, and the `platform` associated with the payout method. The response will include the transaction data and status, allowing you to verify if the payout was successful.

## What's Next?

You can configure webhooks to stay up to date with all updates related to users, transfers, and payouts. To do so, access the [Webhooks](/references/webhooks) documentation page in Dots.
